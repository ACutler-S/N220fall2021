//Lab for week 2: Animation and Conditional Operations

//Create an orange circle that mirrors the mouse and is in the opposite side of the canvas

//Create a canvas 
//store xcoord and ycoord as variables
//After the stored coords, Create a circle that is mirrored to the cursor
    //Could do this by flipping 

    //circle( 400 - mouseX, 400 - mouseY, 25);
    //THis is the math behind the problem
